# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using the passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).
